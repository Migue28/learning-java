# Journey to Data Engineering 🚀

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my journey to becoming a **Data Engineer**! Through this project, I will be exploring core concepts, tools, and technologies essential for data engineering, particularly focusing on Java as my primary programming language.

## 📚 What I'm Learning

My journey is structured into several key phases, each designed to build upon my existing knowledge of programming and expand my expertise in data engineering:

1. **Java Fundamentals** – mastering the syntax, OOP principles, and basic Java libraries.
2. **Core Java for Data Engineering** – delving into file I/O, collections, streams, and multithreading for data manipulation.
3. **Database Interaction** – working with JDBC to connect, query, and manage databases.
4. **Data Processing Frameworks** – using industry-standard tools like Apache Kafka and Apache Spark.
5. **Advanced Java** – focusing on JVM internals, memory management, and performance optimization.
6. **Building Projects** – creating real-world applications and systems, including data pipelines and ETL processes.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

Throughout this journey, I will be working with:

- **Java**
- **JDBC** for database connectivity
- **Apache Kafka** for data streaming
- **Apache Spark** for distributed data processing
- **SQL** for database interaction

## 📝 Projects

Here are some key projects I’ll be working on:

- Basic CRUD operations in Java.
- CSV processing with Java Streams and multithreading.
- Real-time messaging system with Kafka.
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline with Spark.

## 🎯 Goal

My goal is to become proficient in building robust, scalable, and efficient data engineering solutions. This repository will serve as a learning space to experiment with different technologies and apply what I learn through hands-on projects.

Feel free to explore the projects and track my progress!

## 📖 Resources

I am leveraging a combination of books, online courses, and documentation to guide my learning:
